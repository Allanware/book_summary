  title: "Empire of Cotton",
  coreArgument:
    "From premodern household cotton worlds—often spun by women and traded as currency—to today’s retailer-led supply chains, the book argues cotton repeatedly reorganized labor, land, and state power to build modern capitalism. European “war capitalism” (chartered companies, armed trade, colonial seizure, and slavery) redirected cotton into Atlantic circuits and pushed plantation frontiers to supply mechanized mills. Industrial capitalism then scaled the system through factory discipline and merchant-finance hubs that standardized grades, prices, credit, and information; after the U.S. Civil War’s cotton famine, empires rebuilt supply through colonial law, infrastructure, and coercive rural credit regimes. In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, production and manufacturing shifted toward Asia and other low-wage regions, while states still subsidize growers and police labor—so coercion persists alongside dramatic productivity gains.",
