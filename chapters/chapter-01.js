    "From roughly 5000 BCE through the 1500s, cotton production developed independently in South Asia, the Americas, and Africa within a climate band of about 32-35 degrees south to 37 degrees north.<sup><a href='#chapter-1-section-1'>1</a></sup><sup><a href='#chapter-1-section-2'>2</a></sup> Households interplanted cotton with food crops, women did most spinning, and cloth served as tribute and currency while India anchored long-distance trade and Asia supplied key processing technologies.<sup><a href='#chapter-1-section-1'>1</a></sup><sup><a href='#chapter-1-section-3'>3</a></sup> Europe entered late through Islamic Mediterranean routes, built northern Italian and southern German industries on imported cotton and borrowed tools, and those industries declined under Ottoman control and German rural cost advantages, pushing Europeans toward Atlantic, state-backed strategies by the late sixteenth century.<sup><a href='#chapter-1-section-4'>4</a></sup>",
