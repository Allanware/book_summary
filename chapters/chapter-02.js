    "Between the late 1400s and late 1700s, European states and chartered companies used oceanic routes, armed shipping, and colonial conquest to redirect Indian cotton textiles into a three-continent trade that purchased enslaved Africans for American plantations.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-2-section-1\">1</a></sup><sup><a href=\"#chapter-2-section-3\">3</a></sup> Company rule in India replaced independent brokers with company agents who advanced cash, imposed exclusive contracts, and enforced production through inspections, penalties, and violence, while European governments blocked Indian textiles and copied Indian dyeing and printing techniques.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-2-section-2\">2</a></sup><sup><a href=\"#chapter-2-section-4\">4</a></sup> These moves shifted cotton trade toward Atlantic ports, expanded export markets in Africa and the Americas, and supplied cash advances and ships that put Britain at the center of global cotton networks by 1780.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-2-section-5\">5</a></sup><sup><a href=\"#chapter-2-section-6\">6</a></sup>",
