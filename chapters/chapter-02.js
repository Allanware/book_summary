  thesis:
    "Between 1492 and 1780, Europeans reshaped the global cotton industry not through technological superiority but through armed oceanic expansion, colonial land seizure, and the mass deportation of Africans—forging a system Beckert calls ‘war capitalism,’ in which privatized violence, state-chartered companies, and slavery divided the world into a lawful metropolitan ‘inside’ and a coercive imperial ‘outside.’<sup><a href=\"#chapter-2-section-1\">1</a></sup> <sup><a href=\"#chapter-2-section-2\">2</a></sup> <sup><a href=\"#chapter-2-section-3\">3</a></sup> European chartered companies inserted themselves into Indian textile networks, first as dependent coastal traders relying on local brokers and then as territorial rulers who imposed exclusive contracts, replaced independent banias with salaried agents, and used inspections and corporal punishment to collapse weavers’ incomes.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-2-section-4\">4</a></sup> Simultaneously, protectionist legislation blocked Indian cloth from European markets, systematic industrial espionage transferred Asian printing and dyeing techniques to European workshops, and slave-trade profits financed a domestic putting-out industry whose export markets in Africa and the Americas made Britain the hub of global cotton networks by 1780—setting the preconditions for the Industrial Revolution.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-2-section-5\">5</a></sup> <sup><a href=\"#chapter-2-section-6\">6</a></sup>",
