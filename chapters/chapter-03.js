  thesis:
    "The British Industrial Revolution in cotton was not a spontaneous local breakthrough but the product of war capitalism’s institutional scaffolding—Atlantic slave capital, Indian technologies, and imperial trade networks—that gave a handful of Lancashire manufacturers the preconditions to mechanize.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-3-section-1\">1</a></sup> <sup><a href=\"#chapter-3-section-2\">2</a></sup> High British wages relative to India combined with the inability to scale putting-out networks drove a mechanization cascade—flying shuttle, jenny, water frame, mule—that multiplied spinning productivity 370-fold in three decades and collapsed yarn prices.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-3-section-3\">3</a></sup> The resulting factory system centralized waterpower, integrated machine sequences, and wage labor in a novel institutional form where, for the first time outside slave plantations, capitalists organized and dominated the production process.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-3-section-4\">4</a></sup> Spectacular profits funded rapid scaling through retained earnings and merchant credit, making cotton the largest sector of the British economy by 1831.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-3-section-5\">5</a></sup> An export boom—flowing predominantly through Atlantic channels built by war capitalism—captured markets formerly dominated by Indian producers and devastated centuries-old manufacturing centers such as Dhaka.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-3-section-6\">6</a></sup> A high-capacity interventionist state underpinned every stage, from naval protection and contract enforcement to industry regulation, while cotton revenues became the fiscal backbone of British hegemony—yet the factories’ insatiable appetite for raw cotton simultaneously reinvigorated slavery and coercive extraction abroad for a ‘terrible ninety years.’<sup><a href=\"#chapter-3-section-7\">7</a></sup>",
