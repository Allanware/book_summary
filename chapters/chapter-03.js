  thesis:
    "From the 1780s into the 1830s, Manchester-Lancashire manufacturers such as Samuel Greg built water- and steam-powered mills that drew on Atlantic slave-grown cotton and Indian finishing knowledge, turning a local valley experiment into a global node of industrial capitalism.<sup><a href='#chapter-3-section-1'>1</a></sup> High wages and putting-out limits pushed inventors toward mechanization (flying shuttle, jenny, water frame, mule) that slashed spinning costs.<sup><a href='#chapter-3-section-2'>2</a></sup> Factory organization centralized production stages and wage labor, a shift enabled by Britain's social structure and state suppression of resistance.<sup><a href='#chapter-3-section-3'>3</a></sup> High profits and merchant credit scaled mills and made cotton central to the British economy.<sup><a href='#chapter-3-section-4'>4</a></sup> An export boom displaced Indian producers and captured Atlantic markets.<sup><a href='#chapter-3-section-5'>5</a></sup> A high-capacity state protected trade and, as factories demanded more raw cotton, reinforced war-capitalist expansion abroad.<sup><a href='#chapter-3-section-6'>6</a></sup>",
