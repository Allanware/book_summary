    "From the 1780s through the 1790s, mechanized British and European mills multiplied demand for raw cotton even though Europe could not grow the crop, forcing manufacturers to depend on long-distance imports and lobby for new supply.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-4-section-1\">1</a></sup> When Ottoman Anatolia and Company-ruled India could not rapidly reallocate land and labor for export, merchants, planters, and states expanded cotton commodity frontiers in the Caribbean and South America through land seizure, slave imports, and targeted incentives—an institutional package historians call \"second slavery\".<sup><a href=\"#chapter-4-section-2\">2</a></sup><sup><a href=\"#chapter-4-section-3\">3</a></sup> But land scarcity, sugar competition, revolution in Saint-Domingue, and wartime disruption exposed fragile supply and pushed industrialists toward the only nearby region large enough to promise stability: the United States.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-4-section-4\">4</a></sup>",
