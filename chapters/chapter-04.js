  thesis:
    "British cotton manufacturing was the first major industry in human history entirely dependent on long-distance imports of raw material, and its explosive demand growth—multiplying many times over in under two decades—could never have been met domestically without consuming an impossibly large share of British farmland and labor.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-4-section-1\">1</a></sup> When Ottoman Anatolia, Company-ruled India, and West Africa proved unable to break precapitalist constraints on rapid land and labor reallocation for export, Caribbean and then South American planters solved the supply crisis through slavery, land expropriation from decimated indigenous populations, and targeted state incentives, forging what historians call \"second slavery\"—a coercive regime tightly coupled to industrial capitalism that absorbed a disproportionate share of the transatlantic slave trade during the industrial era.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-4-section-2\">2</a></sup> <sup><a href=\"#chapter-4-section-3\">3</a></sup> <sup><a href=\"#chapter-4-section-4\">4</a></sup> <sup><a href=\"#chapter-4-section-5\">5</a></sup> Yet even this war-capitalist model hit structural limits—island land scarcity, sugar competition for labor, and revolutionary slave uprisings—pushing manufacturers toward the one nearby region large enough to promise elastic supply: the newly born United States.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-4-section-6\">6</a></sup>",
