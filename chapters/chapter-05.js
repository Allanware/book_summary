    "From the 1780s through the 1850s, U.S. planters turned cotton from a suspect import into the world's dominant raw material by combining West Indian/Mediterranean cultivation knowledge, Sea Island seed, and Whitney's gin to ignite a cotton rush in the South's interior.<sup><a href='#chapter-5-section-1'>1</a></sup> Soil exhaustion and price spikes then pushed a westward plantation frontier built on federal land acquisitions, Native dispossession, and river-rail transport that opened the Mississippi Valley and Delta to cotton.<sup><a href='#chapter-5-section-2'>2</a></sup> The system rested on slave markets, forced migrations, plantation economies of scale, and violent labor discipline under a slaveholder-dominated state that expanded slavery into new territories.<sup><a href='#chapter-5-section-3'>3</a></sup> Transatlantic merchant networks and slave-mortgage credit tied Liverpool and London capital to Southern plantations, funding seed experiments and highly capitalized estates that lowered cotton prices and deepened U.S.-European integration.<sup><a href='#chapter-5-section-4'>4</a></sup> By midcentury, Britain's dependence on slave-grown U.S. cotton spurred alternative-supply campaigns in India and Egypt, but weak infrastructure, peasant resistance, and coercive state limits left those efforts marginal and kept the U.S. core of war capitalism dominant.<sup><a href='#chapter-5-section-5'>5</a></sup>",
