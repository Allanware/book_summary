    "British cotton manufacturing's insatiable demand for raw fiber catalyzed an American cotton revolution that within a remarkably short period transformed the United States from a negligible producer into Britain's single largest cotton supplier, with slave-grown cotton ultimately underwriting the entire Western industrial order.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-5-section-1\">1</a></sup> This explosive rise rested on a convergence of historical contingencies—colonial growing knowledge, Caribbean seed transfers, the elimination of a major competitor through slave rebellion, and a ginning innovation that revolutionized processing productivity—with structural advantages in land, labor, and political power that no other cotton-growing region could match.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-5-section-1\">1</a></sup> <sup><a href=\"#chapter-5-section-2\">2</a></sup> A 'military-cotton complex' expropriated Native American lands through federal treaties, wars, and forced removals so that the vast majority of U.S. cotton eventually grew on recently acquired territory, while rivers, steamboats, and railroads carried the crop to world markets at a fraction of competitors' costs.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-5-section-2\">2</a></sup> Slavery furnished an enormous captive labor force, with massive numbers of enslaved people forcefully relocated to the Deep South and systematic violence—from the whip to torture-driven labor accounting—producing relentless productivity gains that no free-labor system could replicate.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-5-section-3\">3</a></sup> <sup><a href=\"#chapter-5-section-5\">5</a></sup> Planter political power, constitutionally enshrined and exercised through slaveholding presidents and dominant state governments, secured territorial expansion and infrastructure while European capital—often mortgaged against slave bodies—flowed through transatlantic networks that bound the London money market to plantation violence.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-5-section-4\">4</a></sup> <sup><a href=\"#chapter-5-section-5\">5</a></sup> Efforts to develop alternative cotton sources in India and Egypt largely failed: Indian peasants defended subsistence priorities, resisted wage labor, and retained control of trade circuits, while Egyptian production depended on state coercion—deepening European dependence on American slavery even as manufacturers recognized the catastrophic fragility of their supply chain.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-5-section-6\">6</a></sup> <sup><a href=\"#chapter-5-section-7\">7</a></sup>",
