    "From the 1780s through the 1860s, mechanized spinning and weaving spread from Britain to Europe, North America, and parts of Latin America and North Africa, as entrepreneurs built mills from the Wiesental to Valladolid and scale jumped in spindles and output.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-6-section-1\">1</a></sup> That diffusion followed older textile districts and putting-out networks that supplied skills, labor, and reinvestable capital, from Chemnitz and Switzerland to New England and Mulhouse.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-6-section-2\">2</a></sup> British export pressure and the leakage of British machinery and know-how (agents, artisans, espionage, and later legal machine exports) accelerated adoption and local machine-building innovation.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-6-section-3\">3</a></sup> Sustained industrialization depended on strong states that could subsidize mills, block British imports, impose tariffs, and build integrated domestic markets, as shown by the continental blockade, U.S. embargo-era growth, and Mexico’s protectionist regime.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-6-section-4\">4</a></sup> Access to overseas markets and imperial power further anchored national industries, while Britain survived protectionism by pushing exports into weaker colonial or semicolonial markets.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-6-section-5\">5</a></sup> Where war capitalism and slavery dominated—Egypt, Brazil, the U.S. South, and colonial India—coercive labor regimes, weak state autonomy, and free-trade impositions undercut industrialization, highlighting the coexistence of war and industrial capitalism and the rise of wage labor as the new factory labor system by mid-century.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-6-section-6\">6</a></sup>",
