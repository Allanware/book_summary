  title: "Mobilizing Industrial Labor",
  pages: "223-252",
  thesis:
    "The cotton factory system required an unprecedented transformation of human labor: millions of women, children, and men had to abandon subsistence farming, artisan crafts, and domestic spinning to join a factory proletariat that organized every aspect of life around the rhythms of machine production—a mobilization whose success or failure opened a decisive chasm between industrializing and non-industrializing regions.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-7-section-1\">1</a></sup> Because slavery—the only existing model for mass labor mobilization—was legally foreclosed in Europe and economically ill-suited to the boom-and-bust cycles of industrial capitalism, manufacturers had to invent a new labor commodity: the wage, purchased from workers who possessed nothing but their capacity to work.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-7-section-2\">2</a></sup> The consolidating nation-state proved indispensable, replacing feudal lords as the instrument of compulsion by enclosing the commons, criminalizing breach of labor contracts under laws like the 1823 Master and Servant Act, and legally compelling paupers, vagrants, and children to work.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-7-section-3\">3</a></sup> The destruction of rural livelihoods—through enclosure, the spread of cheap machine-made goods, and capital's penetration ever deeper into the countryside—drove millions from farm to factory, while proto-industrialization had already accustomed many to wage dependency and manufacturers exploited semi-proletarianized families by paying extremely low wages.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-7-section-4\">4</a></sup> Manufacturers recruited the weakest members of society first—children who constituted up to half the workforce and women who earned as little as 45 percent of male wages—exploiting patriarchal household structures and the persistence of noncapitalist subsistence to keep labor costs extraordinarily low.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-7-section-5\">5</a></sup> Inside the factories, discipline was maintained through beatings, fines, and surveillance techniques borrowed from slave plantations, while working conditions were so devastating that the Industrial Revolution produced no measurable improvement in workers' food consumption, longevity, or housing for nearly a century.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-7-section-6\">6</a></sup> Yet the very nationalization of labor control that enabled capitalists to dominate workers paradoxically created political spaces for collective action—machine breaking, trade unions, strikes, and eventually suffrage—through which workers began reshaping the terms of industrial capitalism, winning 'employment at will' through decades of struggle rather than as a natural outgrowth of the factory system.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-7-section-7\">7</a></sup>",
