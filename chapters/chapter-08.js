  thesis:
    "From the early 1800s through the 1860s, Liverpool's port, exchange, and price signals centralized the cotton economy, allowing its merchants to coordinate shipping, labor, and finance across the Atlantic and displace older multipolar cotton networks.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-8-section-1\">1</a></sup> Merchants then stitched together global commodity chains that moved cotton from slave plantations to European mills and out to world consumers, helping cotton dominate British and U.S. export earnings by 1860.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-8-section-2\">2</a></sup> To make that flow reliable, they built institutional machinery such as brokers, sampling, grading standards, and forward contracts, and consolidated import power in large houses such as the Barings and Browns.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-8-section-3\">3</a></sup> <sup><a href=\"#chapter-8-section-4\">4</a></sup> The system rested on credit and factors that collateralized enslaved people and future crops, on information and trust networks that managed price risk, and on state-backed infrastructure and law that eventually shifted influence toward industrial capital and sharpened the U.S. split between slaveholders and industrialists before 1861.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-8-section-5\">5</a></sup> <sup><a href=\"#chapter-8-section-6\">6</a></sup> <sup><a href=\"#chapter-8-section-7\">7</a></sup>",
