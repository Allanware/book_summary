  thesis:
    "Liverpool merchants became the ringmasters of a globe-spanning cotton empire by fusing industrial capitalism with war capitalism—combining antagonistic elements such as wage labor and slavery, free trade and empire—and establishing a unipolar network of pricing, shipping, and finance that displaced older multipolar trading centers.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-8-section-1\">1</a></sup> A vast array of specialized merchants—factors, brokers, importers, exporters—stitched together the world's first truly global commodity chain, connecting slave plantations to industrial mills to colonial bazaars through tens of thousands of credit-mediated ties that made cotton the dominant commodity in transatlantic trade.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-8-section-2\">2</a></sup> To manage this explosive growth, brokers replaced local dealers and built institutional innovations—buying by sample, standardized grading categories, and forward contracts—that abstracted cotton's natural diversity into tradable industrial commodities, subordinating the logic of nature to the logic of capital.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-8-section-3\">3</a></sup> Major transatlantic import houses consolidated enormous market share by handling staggering volumes of slave-produced cotton, while continental rivals built parallel networks feeding European industry beyond Britain.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-8-section-4\">4</a></sup> Credit was the empire's circulatory system: metropolitan capital flowed through intermediaries to planters, collateralized by future crops and by enslaved people themselves, making the empire of cotton fundamentally an empire of credit—yet fatally vulnerable to recurring financial panics.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-8-section-5\">5</a></sup> Across vast distances, merchants managed risk through information networks, price circulars, chambers of commerce, and kinship- and diaspora-based trust ties that linked distant markets within single commercial firms.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-8-section-6\">6</a></sup> Yet European capital could penetrate the cotton-growing countryside only where slavery prevailed; in peasant regions, local merchants resisted incorporation until imperial states gained sufficient administrative and military capacity—a state-building dynamic that sharpened the irreconcilable conflict between slaveholding planters and rising industrial capitalists, ultimately erupting in civil war.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-8-section-7\">7</a></sup>",
