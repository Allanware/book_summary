  thesis:
    "The American Civil War was the first global raw materials crisis, exposing how thoroughly industrial capitalism depended on slave-produced American cotton—which by 1860 supplied 77 percent of Britain's, 90 percent of France's, and 92 percent of Russia's raw fiber—and demonstrating that this dependence rested on a 'treacherous foundation' vulnerable to sectional conflict and slave resistance.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-9-section-1\">1</a></sup> When the Confederate embargo and Union blockade cut exports from 3.8 million bales in 1860 to virtually nothing in 1862, a devastating 'cotton famine' shuttered mills across Europe, threw more than half a million Lancashire workers into destitution, and ignited social upheaval from Alsace to Moscow.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-9-section-2\">2</a></sup> The crisis simultaneously enriched speculators and catalyzed institutional innovations such as formal futures markets in Liverpool and Bombay, while manufacturers frantically demanded that governments secure alternative cotton sources—transforming cotton from a merchant-dominated commodity into a matter of national survival and foreshadowing a new imperialism of raw materials.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-9-section-3\">3</a></sup> British and French imperial bureaucracies responded by pushing infrastructure, coercive contract laws, and land reforms into colonial countrysides—above all India—where even laissez-faire champions like The Economist endorsed state intervention to compel peasant cotton production for world markets.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-9-section-4\">4</a></sup> India, Egypt, Brazil, and dozens of other regions rapidly expanded cultivation under wartime prices and colonial pressure, demonstrating that the global countryside could supply European mills without American slavery—albeit only under sharply elevated prices and unprecedented coercion.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-9-section-5\">5</a></sup> The geopolitical stakes of cotton shaped diplomacy on all sides, as Liverpool's pro-Confederate merchants agitated for recognition while Union diplomats worked to demonstrate that alternative sources could neutralize the South's 'cotton weapon' and forestall European intervention.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-9-section-6\">6</a></sup> Most profoundly, four million enslaved people seized the crisis to press for their own emancipation through an 'agrarian insurrection,' destroying chattel slavery as the foundation of the cotton empire and forcing capitalists and statesmen to envision new labor regimes—sharecropping, coolie labor, wage work—that would reconstruct the global web of cotton production through indirect coercion and unprecedented state activism rather than direct ownership of human beings.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-9-section-7\">7</a></sup>",
