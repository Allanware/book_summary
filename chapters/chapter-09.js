  thesis:
    "By 1861 the world cotton industry depended on U.S. slave-grown fiber for most European consumption, making global manufacturing vulnerable to American politics.<sup><a href='#chapter-9-section-1'>1</a></sup> The Confederate export ban and Union blockade then collapsed exports and triggered a cotton famine that idled mills and caused mass unemployment across Britain, France, Germany, and Russia.<sup><a href='#chapter-9-section-2'>2</a></sup> Merchants' speculative gains and manufacturers' panic pushed states into an unprecedented cotton policy, using law, infrastructure, and colonial expansion to scale supply in India, Egypt, Brazil, and other regions.<sup><a href='#chapter-9-section-3'>3</a></sup> <sup><a href='#chapter-9-section-4'>4</a></sup> <sup><a href='#chapter-9-section-5'>5</a></sup> The crisis also rewired diplomacy and labor: European recognition pressure rose, U.S. diplomats promoted alternative sources, and emancipation forced new labor regimes, convincing cotton capitalists and states that global networks now required active state power to survive.<sup><a href='#chapter-9-section-6'>6</a></sup> <sup><a href='#chapter-9-section-7'>7</a></sup>",
