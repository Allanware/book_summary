  thesis:
    "The emancipation of enslaved cotton growers triggered a global crisis for the empire of cotton, forcing capitalists and statesmen to invent new ways of mobilizing labor without slavery—a reconstruction that ultimately drew on the coercive powers of newly consolidating nation-states rather than the whip of the master.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-10-section-1\">1</a></sup> In the American South, a protracted struggle among freedpeople, planters, and the federal government produced sharecropping as a social compromise, giving freed families autonomy from gang labor but trapping them in cycles of debt, falling cotton prices, and political dispossession that left them in an ambiguous zone between bondage and genuine freedom.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-10-section-2\">2</a></sup> <sup><a href=\"#chapter-10-section-3\">3</a></sup> Meanwhile, yeoman farmers, immigrant laborers, and convict lessees were also swept into cotton production, enabling a dramatic recovery of output and making the American post-emancipation transition a model studied by imperial powers worldwide.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-10-section-4\">4</a></sup> Across colonized and semi-peripheral regions, imperial and local states deployed railroads, telegraph lines, new property rights, cash taxation, and the destruction of communal resources to transform subsistence-oriented peasantries into producers of raw cotton for world markets—reimagining entire regions as vast cotton-producing zones serving metropolitan industry.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-10-section-5\">5</a></sup> <sup><a href=\"#chapter-10-section-6\">6</a></sup> Yet rural cultivators across the globe resisted these transformations, and where cheap labor could not be secured, cotton growing failed entirely, revealing that industrial capitalism's expansion depended not on impersonal market forces but on specific configurations of state coercion, credit dependency, and the suppression of peasant autonomy.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-10-section-7\">7</a></sup>",
