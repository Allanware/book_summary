  thesis:
    "After emancipation in 1865 and amid rapidly expanding global textile capacity, cotton industrialists and states treated labor as the bottleneck and set out to reconstruct cotton production through law, credit, and state power that could override subsistence farming.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-10-section-1\">1</a></sup> In the U.S. South, planters' attempts to restore plantation discipline collided with freedpeople's land claims, producing coercive contract regimes and a sharecropping compromise that still trapped growers in debt and repression.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-10-section-2\">2</a></sup> <sup><a href=\"#chapter-10-section-3\">3</a></sup> Railroads, merchants, and forced labor (including convict leasing) pulled white yeomen and landless workers into cotton, and by the 1870s-1890s U.S. output recovered to dominate world markets, becoming a model for imperial planners.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-10-section-3\">3</a></sup> Outside the United States, output surged in India, Egypt, and Brazil while colonial states in places like Berar and the Nile Delta built railways, telegraphs, and new property regimes that dismantled local manufacturing and concentrated land and debt to force export agriculture.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-10-section-4\">4</a></sup> <sup><a href=\"#chapter-10-section-5\">5</a></sup> Governments then systematized agronomic knowledge, rewrote contracts and taxes, and experimented with seeds; resistance and labor scarcity yielded a patchwork of sharecropping, tenant, and wage labor enforced by coercion and imperial competition, pushing prices below prewar levels by the 1890s.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-10-section-6\">6</a></sup>",
