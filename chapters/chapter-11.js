    "After 1865, imperial states and manufacturers used rail, telegraph, and military reach to pull cultivators in India, Egypt, the U.S. South, Brazil, and later West Africa and Central Asia into new cotton labor systems, destroying older merchant networks and household spinning and weaving as they integrated the countryside without slavery.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-11-section-1\">1</a></sup> European and Japanese firms then moved inland, built gins, presses, and purchasing agencies, and marginalized local traders and planters from Berar to the U.S. South.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-11-section-2\">2</a></sup> Cotton trade governance shifted to exchanges, futures, and state standards and statistics that created a single world price and reduced traditional intermediaries.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-11-section-3\">3</a></sup> Colonial administrations deliberately built markets for metropolitan textiles through tariffs, infrastructure, and market intelligence, driving deindustrialization and peasantization across India, the Ottoman Empire, China, and beyond.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-11-section-4\">4</a></sup> Household producers adapted through niche goods and intensified female and child labor while facing repression and massive employment loss.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-11-section-5\">5</a></sup> Export-cotton specialization then eroded food security, deepened debt and price volatility, sparked famines and rural rebellions, and fed populist and nationalist politics even as cotton expanded into Korea, Central Asia, and Africa.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-11-section-6\">6</a></sup>",
