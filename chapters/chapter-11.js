    "The rapid expansion of industrial capitalism after slavery's crisis drove a double process of creative destruction across the global countryside: metropolitan merchants backed by imperial states displaced older merchant networks and vertically integrated the cotton trade from field to factory across multiple continents.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-11-section-1\">1</a></sup> The rise of cotton exchanges, futures contracts, and standardized grading replaced trust-based merchant relationships with impersonal, finance-dominated institutions, while states assumed classification and statistical functions that actively constructed the market itself.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-11-section-2\">2</a></sup> Simultaneously, manufacturers and imperial governments flooded the ancient cotton heartlands with machine-made yarn and cloth, triggering an unprecedented wave of deindustrialization that dispossessed vast populations of spinners and weavers—especially women—and pushed them into agricultural labor through mass peasantization.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-11-section-3\">3</a></sup> <sup><a href=\"#chapter-11-section-4\">4</a></sup> Local producers adapted through niche specialization and gendered household labor, but incomplete capitalist transition enabled their super-exploitation rather than their survival, while collective resistance was crushed by imperial states.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-11-section-5\">5</a></sup> The radical reorientation of the countryside toward cotton monoculture undermined food security so catastrophically that massive famines resulted, while volatile world market prices introduced existential uncertainty into cultivators' lives.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-11-section-6\">6</a></sup> Cotton growers across the global South responded with rebellion—targeting moneylenders, destroying land records, forming political movements—giving rise to cotton populism and, ultimately, anticolonial nationalism that would reshape the empire of cotton.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-11-section-7\">7</a></sup>",
