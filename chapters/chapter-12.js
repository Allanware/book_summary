  thesis:
    "After emancipation, cotton manufacturers and states fused into a new imperial cotton rush: price shocks, supply fears, and the goal of raw-material independence pushed governments to seize territory, build infrastructure, and engineer labor regimes beyond slavery, shifting control from merchant networks to state-centered systems.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-12-section-1\">1</a></sup> Japan’s colonial program in Korea shows how bureaucracies and spinners imported foreign models, American seed, and credit to redirect peasant cotton toward export to Japanese mills.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-12-section-2\">2</a></sup> Russia’s conquest of Central Asia likewise paired railroads, irrigation, tariffs, and crop-advance credit with coercive social reordering to build a national cotton colony.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-12-section-3\">3</a></sup> Across older and new frontiers—from Egypt and the Ottoman Cukurova to Brazil and the U.S. West—states opened land, displaced Indigenous people, and added tens of millions of acres to world cotton production.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-12-section-4\">4</a></sup> In Africa, especially German Togo, colonial regimes combined technical experts, price controls, taxes, and forced labor to redirect local cotton economies, but subsistence priorities and competing spinners limited export gains even as coercion escalated.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-12-section-5\">5</a></sup> The result was a more global yet more unequal cotton order: imperial states coordinated markets and exchanged expertise across borders while rural producers became a marginalized periphery feeding a growing spindle base in the Global South.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-12-section-6\">6</a></sup>",
