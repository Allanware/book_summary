  thesis:
    "In the decades after the American Civil War, European, American, and Japanese manufacturers confronted persistent supply anxieties and fears of dependence on a single source, driving them to pressure their governments into an unprecedented colonial cotton rush to secure raw materials on nationally controlled territory.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-12-section-1\">1</a></sup> Russia's conquest and infrastructural transformation of Central Asia demonstrated how state-backed colonialism could expand cotton production on a massive scale, providing a model that rival imperial powers sought to emulate.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-12-section-2\">2</a></sup> Manufacturers organized powerful national associations that fused industrial capital with state power in a new nationally organized cotton empire, pushing the commodity frontier into Africa and beyond.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-12-section-3\">3</a></sup> The territorial scope was vast: enormous new acreage was planted with cotton worldwide—from the American West to Egypt, Brazil, and across colonial Africa—overwhelmingly on territories not previously growing cotton, and in the United States this expansion required the systematic dispossession of Native American peoples.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-12-section-4\">4</a></sup> The core challenge everywhere was labor: how to mobilize cultivators without slavery, through credit dependence, settling of nomads, or integration of indigenous farmers into export-oriented production—strategies that often reproduced the coercive dynamics of the old regime, creating sharecropping, mass landlessness, and famine.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-12-section-5\">5</a></sup> Colonial cotton experiments in Africa became microcosms of these tensions, revealing that peasant resistance, thriving indigenous industries, and subsistence security could frustrate colonial ambitions even as coercion intensified.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-12-section-6\">6</a></sup> Ultimately, the new cotton imperialism created a global periphery of politically and economically marginalized agricultural producers while paradoxically binding competing nation-states into an ever more interdependent global network centered on the cotton supply question.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-12-section-7\">7</a></sup>",
