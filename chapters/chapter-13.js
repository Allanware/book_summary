  thesis:
    "From Ahmedabad's 1860s merchant-financed mills to the interwar rise of Japan, India, and China, cotton manufacturing shifted back toward the global South as local capital and commercial networks built mechanized capacity that rivaled North Atlantic firms.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-13-section-1\">1</a></sup> <sup><a href=\"#chapter-13-section-2\">2</a></sup> In Britain, continental Europe, and New England, organized workers and stronger labor states raised wages, shortened hours, and squeezed profits, pushing a race to the lowest-cost producers despite tariffs and imperial markets.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-13-section-3\">3</a></sup> Capital relocated to internal and external peripheries such as the U.S. South and other low-wage regions where weak labor regulation and cheap labor restored margins.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-13-section-4\">4</a></sup> In Brazil and Japan, state-backed protection, export promotion, and harsh labor regimes turned latecomer industries into fast-growing manufacturing powers.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-13-section-5\">5</a></sup> In colonized regions like Egypt, India, and China, industrialization required nationalist mobilization against imperial market controls and culminated in postcolonial, state-centered industrial capitalism by mid-century.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-13-section-6\">6</a></sup>",
