    "From the earliest merchant-financed steam mills in the global South to postcolonial nationalizations, cotton manufacturing migrated back toward its historical heartlands as two mutually reinforcing processes—worker mobilization in the industrial core and activist state-building in the periphery—reshaped the geography of global capitalism.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-13-section-1\">1</a></sup> <sup><a href=\"#chapter-13-section-2\">2</a></sup> In Britain, continental Europe, and New England, strikes, unions, and working-class political parties won shorter hours, higher wages, and protective legislation, squeezing profits and making high-wage producers vulnerable to low-cost competitors despite tariff walls and imperial markets.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-13-section-3\">3</a></sup> Capital relocated first to internal peripheries—where cheap labor, child labor, and weak regulation reproduced early-industrial conditions—and then to external low-wage zones across multiple continents.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-13-section-4\">4</a></sup> In semi-sovereign nations, aspiring industrialists captured or co-opted state power, erected tariff barriers or leveraged export promotion and imperial conquest, and exploited disenfranchised women and children to build world-class cotton industries within decades.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-13-section-5\">5</a></sup> In colonized regions, the struggle for cotton industrialization collided with imperial states that defended metropolitan export markets, forcing local capitalists into alliances with nationalist movements and mass politics.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-13-section-6\">6</a></sup> These alliances ultimately produced postcolonial, state-centered industrial orders in which cotton workers' mobilization translated into nationalization, central planning, and a radical merger of state and capital.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-13-section-7\">7</a></sup>",
