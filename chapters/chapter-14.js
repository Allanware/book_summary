    "The North Atlantic cotton empire eventually collapsed as European dominance over global textile trade disintegrated, yet the empire itself persisted and expanded to unprecedented scale, with production re-centered in Asia and the global South across multi-country supply chains.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-14-section-1\">1</a></sup> <sup><a href=\"#chapter-14-section-2\">2</a></sup> Cotton growing shifted decisively toward the global South, mobilizing enormous populations, yet coercion and debt continued to define the cotton countryside—from forced cultivation and ecological devastation to farmer dispossession and growers' dependence on massive state subsidies.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-14-section-3\">3</a></sup> State-led development across multiple political systems—communist planning, colonial irrigation investments, market nationalization, and agricultural subsidies—drove Asia's industrial renaissance and redrew the empire's geography, making state-directed growth the global norm.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-14-section-4\">4</a></sup> In more recent decades, giant multinational retailers replaced manufacturers as the empire's key coordinators, emancipating capital from dependence on any single state while still relying on state subsidies and labor coercion to sustain a global race to the bottom.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-14-section-5\">5</a></sup> The chapter concludes that capitalism's essence is the constant spatial recombination of labor, land, and capital, with violence and coercion at its core rather than as aberrations—yet the dramatic cheapening of cotton goods over time reveals the system's dual legacy of exploitation and material advance.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-14-section-6\">6</a></sup>",
