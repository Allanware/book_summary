  thesis:
    "In the 1960s-2010s, the cotton empire outlived Europe’s mills and re-centered production in Asia and the global South, with the 1963 Liverpool Cotton Association auction, the U.K.’s collapse to a 2.8 percent export share, and today’s multi-country apparel chain showing a geographic reversal to earlier cotton heartlands.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-14-section-1\">1</a></sup> <sup><a href=\"#chapter-14-section-2\">2</a></sup> That re-centering depends on a massive global farm and mill workforce, yet cotton growing remains coercive and debt-ridden from Uzbekistan to India despite the industry’s scale.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-14-section-3\">3</a></sup> Mid-century state-led development in China, India, the Soviet Union, and the United States expanded output through planning and subsidies, but since the 1970s retailers such as Walmart and Carrefour have coordinated supply chains by pitting suppliers and states against each other while still relying on state labor and subsidy regimes.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-14-section-4\">4</a></sup> <sup><a href=\"#chapter-14-section-5\">5</a></sup> The epilogue concludes that capitalism’s constant spatial recombination keeps coercion and inequality central even as productivity rises, sustaining a race to the bottom alongside the possibility of a more just cotton economy.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-14-section-6\">6</a></sup>",
