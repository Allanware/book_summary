    "Once mechanized cotton spinning emerged in Britain, it spread across multiple continents with striking speed, driven by entrepreneurs seeking the extraordinary profits that new manufacturing technology promised.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-6-section-1\">1</a></sup> Yet this diffusion was far from uniform: early adopters universally shared prior textile traditions and putting-out networks that supplied the skills, labor, and organizational knowledge necessary to operate factories.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-6-section-2\">2</a></sup> Capital for the new mills came from diverse sources—reinvested artisan savings, merchant fortunes accumulated in Atlantic trade, and tightly intermarried kinship networks—with initial investments often remarkably modest.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-6-section-3\">3</a></sup> British competitive pressure simultaneously destroyed hand spinners worldwide and catalyzed adoption, while industrial espionage, migrating artisans, and eventual machine exports diffused the necessary technology rapidly across borders.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-6-section-4\">4</a></sup> The decisive variable separating industrializers from non-industrializers, however, was state capacity: only governments able to protect domestic markets through tariffs, build infrastructure, forge internal markets, and secure colonial outlets could nurture cotton factories into a full-fledged industry—a pattern epitomized by wartime trade disruptions that provided crucial incubation periods for continental European industrialization.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-6-section-5\">5</a></sup> Where war capitalism dominated domestic political economy—as in regions where coerced labor and vulnerability to imperial pressure destroyed promising industrialization efforts—the institutional framework for sustained industrial capitalism could not take root.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-6-section-6\">6</a></sup> Across the slaveholding and colonized world, war capitalism concentrated capital in agriculture, blocked protectionism, and denied states the capacity to support manufacturing, demonstrating that war capitalism simultaneously enabled industrialization in some regions while preventing it everywhere else—revealing the deep interdependence of these divergent but mutually constitutive forms of capitalism.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-6-section-7\">7</a></sup>",
