  thesis:
    "Before industrial mechanization, cotton became a global commodity through household-based production systems that developed independently across South Asia, the Americas, and Africa inside a shared subtropical ecological band, then fed tribute and regional exchange networks rather than plantation monoculture.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-1-section-1\">1</a></sup> <sup><a href=\"#chapter-1-section-2\">2</a></sup> Merchants linked selected cotton zones into long-distance circuits, but production remained organized through rural households, gendered labor, and putting-out finance, which expanded output without fully transforming social relations.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-1-section-3\">3</a></sup> <sup><a href=\"#chapter-1-section-4\">4</a></sup> Europe's first cotton industries depended on Islamic trade routes, imported fiber, and borrowed technologies; when Ottoman state power and supply-chain shocks hit those routes, Europeans turned toward Atlantic strategies that tied cotton success to coercive state projection.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-1-section-5\">5</a></sup>",
