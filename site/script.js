  title: "Empire of Cotton",
  coreArgument:
    "Cotton was the engine of modern capitalism. The book argues that global cotton networks were remade by war capitalism (state power, violence, and long-distance trade tools), then amplified by industrialization, repeatedly reorganizing labor, land, and markets. Each chapter traces how this empire shifted geographies, survived crises, and reappeared in new centers, leaving a persistent pattern of violence and forced labor even as production moved around the world.",

      thesis:
        "From roughly 5000 BCE through the 1500s, cotton production developed independently in South Asia, the Americas, and Africa within a climate band of about 32-35 degrees south to 37 degrees north. Households interplanted cotton with food crops, women did most spinning, and cloth served as tribute and currency while India anchored long-distance trade and Asia supplied key processing technologies. Europe entered late through Islamic Mediterranean routes, built northern Italian and southern German industries on imported cotton and borrowed tools, and those industries declined under Ottoman control and German rural cost advantages, pushing Europeans toward Atlantic, state-backed strategies by the late sixteenth century.",

Mechanization and factory discipline collapsed yarn and cloth prices, drove an export boom that displaced Indian producers, and linked the new industrial capitalism to a high-capacity state that protected markets and, by demanding more raw cotton, renewed war-capitalist expansion abroad.",
