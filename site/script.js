  title: "Empire of Cotton",
  coreArgument:
    "Cotton was the engine of modern capitalism. The book argues that global cotton networks were remade by war capitalism (state power, violence, and long-distance trade tools), then amplified by industrialization, repeatedly reorganizing labor, land, and markets. Each chapter traces how this empire shifted geographies, survived crises, and reappeared in new centers, leaving a persistent pattern of violence and forced labor even as production moved around the world.",
