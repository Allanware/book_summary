  title: "Empire of Cotton",
  coreArgument:
    "Cotton was the engine of modern capitalism. The book argues that global cotton networks were remade by war capitalism (state power, violence, and long-distance trade tools), then amplified by industrialization, repeatedly reorganizing labor, land, and markets. Each chapter traces how this empire shifted geographies, survived crises, and reappeared in new centers, leaving a persistent pattern of violence and forced labor even as production moved around the world.",

        "Between the 1780s and mid-19th century in Britain, continental Europe, and New England, cotton industrialization depended on mobilizing vast numbers of workers into mills, a shift exemplified by child labor and the new machine-timed routines of factory life.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-7-section-1\">1</a></sup> States and capitalists converted subsistence producers into wage workers through rural transformation and legal coercion that bound labor to contracts.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-7-section-2\">2</a></sup> Recruitment pulled migrants and farm families into factories through seasonal and household strategies that kept ties to land while supplying labor.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-7-section-3\">3</a></sup> Employers relied on cheap child and female labor, exploiting patriarchal household power and wage differentials to staff mills at scale.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-7-section-4\">4</a></sup> Discipline inside factories rested on surveillance, corporal punishment, confinement, and punishing hours that damaged health.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-7-section-5\">5</a></sup> Workers resisted mechanization and employer power, prompting harsh state repression of machine breaking and collective action.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-7-section-6\">6</a></sup> Over time, strikes and unions won legal reforms and pushed capital to relocate, even as the cotton empire still depended on the parallel growth of wage-labor factories and slave plantations linked by merchants.<sup><a href=\"#chapter-7-section-7\">7</a></sup>",
